# Project: Exploratory Data Analysis of the Airbnb market in Chania

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis of the Airbnb market in Chania. This project is aimed at Airbnb hosts to help them understand the local market in Chania. 
As an Airbnb host in Chania, Crete, I was always astonished by the increase in Airbnb rentals on my island. Below is my data analysis explanation to help understand how that market has evolved and what matters the most now.

Let’s take a look at the following questions:
- What are the different types of properties in Chania? Do they vary by neighbourhood?
- Which cities are rated highly by guests?
- What is the distribution of prices by neighbourhood?
- What are the characteristics of the listing which sell at the highest price?
- Factors that are correlated the most with Airbnb superhosts

- The average price per person ranges from 25-35 euros per night across all cities. Chania and Platanias have the highest range of prices above this.
